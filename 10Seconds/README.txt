Using Flixel v2.55 (29th of May 2013)

Hello!
This is a template for flixel-games, using FlashDevelop, created by Schulles (schulles.newgrounds.com).
You are free to use and extend this in any way.

To use this, just open the Project-File with FlashDevelop and press 'F5' to compile.

1) Your game entry starts at PlayState.as.
2) To change the screen resolution, fps or zoom open Game.as.
3) The Preloader.as is setting up the Newgrounds API and connects to it. Change the two variables at the top with your API ID (line 11) and Encryption Key (line 12) and you're done.
4) At the path 'org/flixel/data/private/' you can add all your graphics, sounds and texts.
	If you open Sources.as you will see examples on how to import them.

If you have questions concerning Flixel try the forum at http://forums.flixel.org/ or your favourite search engine,
or contact me.

Have fun making great games! ;)
